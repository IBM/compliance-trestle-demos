# au-2 - Audit and Accountability Event Logging

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit function: \[au-2_prm_1 = organization-defined event types that the system is capable of logging\];
- \[b.\] Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;
- \[c.\] Specify the following event types for logging within the system: \[au-2_prm_2 = organization-defined event types (subset of the event types defined in [AU-2a.](#au-2_smt.a)) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type\];
- \[d.\] Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and
- \[e.\] Review and update the event types selected for logging \[au-2_prm_3 = organization-defined frequency\].
