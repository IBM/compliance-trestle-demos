# ir-8 - \[Incident Response\] Incident Response Plan

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Develop an incident response plan that:

  - \[1.\] Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability;
  - \[2.\] Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability;

  - \[4.\] Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions;
  - \[5.\] Defines reportable incidents;
  - \[6.\] Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization;
  - \[7.\] Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability;
  - \[8.\] Addresses the sharing of incident information;
  - \[9.\] Is reviewed and approved by organization-defined personnel or roles organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[10.\] Explicitly designates responsibility for incident response to organization-defined entities, personnel, or roles.

- \[c.\] Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;

- \[d.\] Communicate incident response plan changes to organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements; and

- \[e.\] Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

## Control Guidance

It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident response. Organizational mission and business functions determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of the incident response capabilities, organizations consider the coordination and sharing of information with external organizations, including external service providers and other organizations involved in the supply chain. For incidents involving personally identifiable information (i.e., breaches), include a process to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and provide that notice accordingly.
