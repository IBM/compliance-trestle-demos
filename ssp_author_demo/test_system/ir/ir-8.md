# ir-8 - Incident Response Incident Response Plan

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Develop an incident response plan that:

  - \[1.\] Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability;
  - \[2.\] Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability;
  - \[3.\] Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization;
  - \[4.\] Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions;
  - \[5.\] Defines reportable incidents;
  - \[6.\] Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization;
  - \[7.\] Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability;
  - \[8.\] Addresses the sharing of incident information;
  - \[9.\] Is reviewed and approved by \[ir-8_prm_1 = organization-defined personnel or roles\] \[ir-8_prm_2 = organization-defined frequency\]; and
  - \[10.\] Explicitly designates responsibility for incident response to \[ir-8_prm_3 = organization-defined entities, personnel, or roles\].

- \[b.\] Distribute copies of the incident response plan to \[ir-8_prm_4 = organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements\];

- \[c.\] Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;

- \[d.\] Communicate incident response plan changes to \[ir-8_prm_5 = organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements\]; and

- \[e.\] Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
