# cp-3 - Contingency Planning Contingency Training

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Provide contingency training to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:

  - \[1.\] Within \[cp-3_prm_1 = organization-defined time period\] of assuming a contingency role or responsibility;
