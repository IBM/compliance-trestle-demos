# cp-2 - Contingency Planning Contingency Plan

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Develop a contingency plan for the system that:

  - \[1.\] Identifies essential mission and business functions and associated contingency requirements;
  - \[2.\] Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;
  - \[3.\] Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact information;
  - \[4.\] Addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite a system disruption, compromise, or failure;
  - \[5.\] Addresses eventual, full system restoration without deterioration of the controls originally planned and implemented;
  - \[6.\] Addresses the sharing of contingency information; and
  - \[7.\] Is reviewed and approved by \[cp-2_prm_1 = organization-defined personnel or roles\];

- \[b.\] Distribute copies of the contingency plan to \[cp-2_prm_2 = organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements\];

- \[c.\] Coordinate contingency planning activities with incident handling activities;

- \[d.\] Review the contingency plan for the system \[cp-2_prm_3 = organization-defined frequency\];

- \[e.\] Update the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, system, or environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation, execution, or testing;

- \[f.\] Communicate contingency plan changes to \[cp-2_prm_4 = organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements\];

- \[g.\] Incorporate lessons learned from contingency plan testing, training, or actual contingency activities into contingency testing and training; and

- \[h.\] Protect the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
