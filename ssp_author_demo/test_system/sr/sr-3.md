# sr-3 - Supply Chain Risk Management Supply Chain Controls and Processes

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Establish a process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes of \[sr-3_prm_1 = organization-defined system or system component\] in coordination with \[sr-3_prm_2 = organization-defined supply chain personnel\];
- \[b.\] Employ the following controls to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system component, or system service and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events: \[sr-3_prm_3 = organization-defined supply chain controls\]; and
- \[c.\] Document the selected and implemented supply chain processes and controls in \[sr-3_prm_4 = \['security and privacy plans', 'supply chain risk management plan', ' \[sr-3_prm_5 = organization-defined document\] '\]\].
