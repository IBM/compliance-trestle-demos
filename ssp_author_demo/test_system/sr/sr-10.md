# sr-10 - \[Supply Chain Risk Management\] Inspection of Systems or Components

## Control Statement

Inspect the following systems or system components at random; at {{ insert: param, sr-10_prm_2 }}, upon {{ insert: param, sr-10_prm_3 }}  to detect tampering: organization-defined systems or system components.

## Control Guidance

The inspection of systems or systems components for tamper resistance and detection addresses physical and logical tampering and is applied to systems and system components removed from organization-controlled areas. Indications of a need for inspection include changes in packaging, specifications, factory location, or entity in which the part is purchased, and when individuals return from travel to high-risk locations.
