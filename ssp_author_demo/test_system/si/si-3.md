# si-3 - System and Information Integrity Malicious Code Protection

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Implement \[si-3_prm_1 = one-or-more \['signature based', 'non-signature based'\]\] malicious code protection mechanisms at system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code;

- \[b.\] Automatically update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures;

- \[c.\] Configure malicious code protection mechanisms to:

  - \[1.\] Perform periodic scans of the system \[si-3_prm_2 = organization-defined frequency\] and real-time scans of files from external sources at \[si-3_prm_3 = one-or-more \['endpoint', 'network entry and exit points'\]\] as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with organizational policy; and
  - \[2.\] \[si-3_prm_4 = one-or-more \['block malicious code', 'quarantine malicious code', 'take \[si-3_prm_5 = organization-defined action\] '\]\]; and send alert to \[si-3_prm_6 = organization-defined personnel or roles\] in response to malicious code detection; and

- \[d.\] Address the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the system.
