## Control Description

- \[a.\] Develop, document, and disseminate to \[sc-1_prm_1 = organization-defined personnel or roles\]:

  - \[1.\] \[sc-1_prm_2 = one-or-more \['Organization-level', 'Mission/business process-level', 'System-level'\]\] system and communications protection policy that:

    - \[(a)\] Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and

  - \[2.\] Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and communications protection policy and the associated system and communications protection controls;

- \[b.\] Designate an \[sc-1_prm_3 = organization-defined official\] to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the system and communications protection policy and procedures; and

- \[c.\] Review and update the current system and communications protection:

  - \[1.\] Policy \[sc-1_prm_4 = organization-defined frequency\] and following \[sc-1_prm_5 = organization-defined events\]; and
