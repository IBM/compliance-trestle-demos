# pl-2 - Planning System Security and Privacy Plans

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Develop security and privacy plans for the system that:

  - \[1.\] Are consistent with the organizationâ€™s enterprise architecture;
  - \[2.\] Explicitly define the constituent system components;
  - \[3.\] Describe the operational context of the system in terms of mission and business processes;
  - \[4.\] Identify the individuals that fulfill system roles and responsibilities;
  - \[5.\] Identify the information types processed, stored, and transmitted by the system;
  - \[6.\] Provide the security categorization of the system, including supporting rationale;
  - \[7.\] Describe any specific threats to the system that are of concern to the organization;
  - \[8.\] Provide the results of a privacy risk assessment for systems processing personally identifiable information;
  - \[9.\] Describe the operational environment for the system and any dependencies on or connections to other systems or system components;
  - \[10.\] Provide an overview of the security and privacy requirements for the system;
  - \[11.\] Identify any relevant control baselines or overlays, if applicable;
  - \[12.\] Describe the controls in place or planned for meeting the security and privacy requirements, including a rationale for any tailoring decisions;
  - \[13.\] Include risk determinations for security and privacy architecture and design decisions;
  - \[14.\] Include security- and privacy-related activities affecting the system that require planning and coordination with \[pl-2_prm_1 = organization-defined individuals or groups\]; and
  - \[15.\] Are reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative prior to plan implementation.

- \[b.\] Distribute copies of the plans and communicate subsequent changes to the plans to \[pl-2_prm_2 = organization-defined personnel or roles\];

- \[c.\] Review the plans \[pl-2_prm_3 = organization-defined frequency\];

- \[d.\] Update the plans to address changes to the system and environment of operation or problems identified during plan implementation or control assessments; and

- \[e.\] Protect the plans from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
