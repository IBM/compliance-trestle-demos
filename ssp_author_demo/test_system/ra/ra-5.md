# ra-5 - Risk Assessment Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications \[ra-5_prm_1 = organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process\] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and reported;

- \[b.\] Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:

  - \[1.\] Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
  - \[2.\] Formatting checklists and test procedures; and
  - \[3.\] Measuring vulnerability impact;

- \[c.\] Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring;

- \[d.\] Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities \[ra-5_prm_2 = organization-defined response times\] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk;

- \[e.\] Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control assessments with \[ra-5_prm_3 = organization-defined personnel or roles\] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems; and

- \[f.\] Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.
