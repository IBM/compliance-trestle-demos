# ra-3 - Risk Assessment Risk Assessment

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Conduct a risk assessment, including:

  - \[1.\] Identifying threats to and vulnerabilities in the system;
  - \[2.\] Determining the likelihood and magnitude of harm from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the system, the information it processes, stores, or transmits, and any related information; and
  - \[3.\] Determining the likelihood and impact of adverse effects on individuals arising from the processing of personally identifiable information;

- \[b.\] Integrate risk assessment results and risk management decisions from the organization and mission or business process perspectives with system-level risk assessments;

- \[c.\] Document risk assessment results in \[ra-3_prm_1 = \['security and privacy plans', 'risk assessment report', ' \[ra-3_prm_2 = organization-defined document\] '\]\];

- \[d.\] Review risk assessment results \[ra-3_prm_3 = organization-defined frequency\];

- \[e.\] Disseminate risk assessment results to \[ra-3_prm_4 = organization-defined personnel or roles\]; and

- \[f.\] Update the risk assessment \[ra-3_prm_5 = organization-defined frequency\] or when there are significant changes to the system, its environment of operation, or other conditions that may impact the security or privacy state of the system.
