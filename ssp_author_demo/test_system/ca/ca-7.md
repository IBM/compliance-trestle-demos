# ca-7 - Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring Continuous Monitoring

## Control Description

- Develop a system-level continuous monitoring strategy and implement continuous monitoring in accordance with the organization-level continuous monitoring strategy that includes:

  - \[a.\] Establishing the following system-level metrics to be monitored: \[ca-7_prm_1 = organization-defined system-level metrics\];
  - \[b.\] Establishing \[ca-7_prm_2 = organization-defined frequencies\] for monitoring and \[ca-7_prm_3 = organization-defined frequencies\] for assessment of control effectiveness;
  - \[c.\] Ongoing control assessments in accordance with the continuous monitoring strategy;
  - \[d.\] Ongoing monitoring of system and organization-defined metrics in accordance with the continuous monitoring strategy;
  - \[e.\] Correlation and analysis of information generated by control assessments and monitoring;
  - \[f.\] Response actions to address results of the analysis of control assessment and monitoring information; and
  - \[g.\] Reporting the security and privacy status of the system to \[ca-7_prm_4 = organization-defined personnel or roles\] \[ca-7_prm_5 = organization-defined frequency\].
