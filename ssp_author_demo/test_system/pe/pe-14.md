# pe-14 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Environmental Controls

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Maintain temperature; humidity; pressure; radiation;  {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_2 }}  levels within the facility where the system resides at organization-defined acceptable levels; and

- \[b.\] Monitor environmental control levels organization-defined frequency.

## Control Guidance

The provision of environmental controls applies primarily to organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources (e.g., data centers, mainframe computer rooms, and server rooms). Insufficient environmental controls, especially in very harsh environments, can have a significant adverse impact on the availability of systems and system components that are needed to support organizational mission and business functions.
