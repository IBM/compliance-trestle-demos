# ac-7 - Access Control Unsuccessful Logon Attempts

## Control Description

- \[a.\] Enforce a limit of \[ac-7_prm_1 = organization-defined number\] consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a \[ac-7_prm_2 = organization-defined time period\]; and
- \[b.\] Automatically \[ac-7_prm_3 = one-or-more \['lock the account or node for an \[ac-7_prm_4 = organization-defined time period\] ', 'lock the account or node until released by an administrator', 'delay next logon prompt per \[ac-7_prm_5 = organization-defined delay algorithm\] ', 'notify system administrator', 'take other \[ac-7_prm_6 = organization-defined action\] '\]\] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
