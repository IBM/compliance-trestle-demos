# ac-20 - Access Control Use of External Systems

## Control Description

- \[a.\] \[ac-20_prm_1 = one-or-more \['Establish \[ac-20_prm_2 = organization-defined terms and conditions\] ', 'Identify \[ac-20_prm_3 = organization-defined controls asserted to be implemented on external systems\] '\]\], consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to:

  - \[1.\] Access the system from external systems; and
  - \[2.\] Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems; or

- \[b.\] Prohibit the use of \[ac-20_prm_4 = organizationally-defined types of external systems\].
